# Protest_Stance_Detection
Twitter stance Transformer and GNN models

We provide all code used in "Social context in political stance detection: Impact and extrapolation". Heterogeneous, referendum, and homogeneous network results were obtained using main.py. We also include the notebooks used for calculating user embeddings and a notebook that recreates User predictions with the User Embeddings as inputs. The benchmarks folder contains re-implementations of relevant benchmarks.

In compliance with X's 2023 ToS, we cannot share the original data, so we share the anonymized predictions and user embeddings used to recreate the results presented in the paper. The relevant datasets are available at: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14207926
