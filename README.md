We provide all code used in "Evaluating the Effect of Heterogeneous User Interactions in Out-of-Sample Stance Classification." Heterogeneous, referendum, and homogeneous results can be run with main.py. We also include the notebooks used for calculating user embeddings. The benchmarks folder contains re-implementations of relevant benchmarks.

Model weights and anonymized edgelists will be uploaded following acceptance for reproducibility purposes. In compliance with X's 2023 ToS, we cannot share the original data.
