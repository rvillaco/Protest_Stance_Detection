# Protest_Stance_Detection
Twitter stance transformer and gnn models

We provide all code used in "Evaluating the Effect of Heterogeneous User Interactions in Out-of-Sample Stance Classification". Heterogeneous, referendum, and homogeneous network results were obtained using main.py. We also include the notebooks used for calculating user embeddings. The benchmarks folder contains re-implementations of relevant benchmarks.

In compliance with X's 2023 ToS, we cannot share the original data, so we share the annonimized predictions used to construct the different tables presented in the paper. The folder "Cross_Predictions" contains the predictions for the out-of-sample robustness analysis used to evaluate the generalization capabilities of the different country classifiers. The "Tweet_Level" folder contains the annonimized tweet predicitions and user edgelists.
